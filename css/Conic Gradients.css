CSS Conic Gradients
A conic gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.

To create a conic gradient you must define at least two colors.

Syntax
background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...);
By default, angle is 0deg and position is center.

If no degree is specified, the colors will be spread equally around the center point.
