What is CSS Flexbox?
Flexbox is short for the Flexible Box Layout module.

Flexbox is a layout method for arranging items in rows or columns.

Flexbox makes it easier to design a flexible responsive layout structure, without using float or positioning.

Flexbox vs. Grid
The CSS Flexbox Layout should be used for one-dimensional layout, with rows OR columns.

The CSS Grid Layout should be used for two-dimensional layout, with rows AND columns.

CSS Flexible Box Layout Module
Before the Flexible Box Layout module, there were four layout modes:

Block, for sections in a webpage
Inline, for text
Table, for two-dimensional table data
Positioned, for explicit position of an element
CSS flexbox is supported in all modern browsers.

CSS Flexbox Components
A flexbox always consists of:

a Flex Container - the parent (container) <div> element
Flex Items - the items inside the container <div>
