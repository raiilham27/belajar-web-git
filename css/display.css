The display Property
The display property is used to specify how an element is shown on a web page.

Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is. The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements.

Block-level Elements
A block-level element ALWAYS starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

The <div> element is a block-level element.
Examples of block-level elements:

<div>
<h1> - <h6>
<p>
<form>
<header>
<footer>
<section>
Inline Elements
An inline element DOES NOT start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is an inline <span> element inside a paragraph.

Examples of inline elements:

<span>
<a>
<img>
ADVERTISEMENTThe display Property Values
The display property has many values:

Value	Description
inline	Displays an element as an inline element
block	Displays an element as a block element
contents	Makes the container disappear, making the child elements children of the element the next level up in the DOM
flex	Displays an element as a block-level flex container
grid	Displays an element as a block-level grid container
inline-block	Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values
inline-flex	Displays an element as an inline-level flex container
inline-grid	Displays an element as an inline-level grid container
inline-table	The element is displayed as an inline-level table
list-item	Let the element behave like a <li> element
run-in	Displays an element as either block or inline, depending on context
table	Let the element behave like a <table> element
table-caption	Let the element behave like a <caption> element
table-column-group	Let the element behave like a <colgroup> element
table-header-group	Let the element behave like a <thead> element
table-footer-group	Let the element behave like a <tfoot> element
table-row-group	Let the element behave like a <tbody> element
table-cell	Let the element behave like a <td> element
table-column	Let the element behave like a <col> element
table-row	Let the element behave like a <tr> element
none	The element is completely removed
initial	Sets this property to its default value
inherit	Inherits this property from its parent element
Display: none;
display: none; is commonly used with JavaScript to hide and show elements without deleting and recreating them. Take a look at our last example on this page if you want to know how this can be achieved.

The <script> element uses display: none; as default.

Override The Default Display Value
As mentioned, every element has a default display value. However, you can override this.

Changing an inline element to a block element, or vice versa, can be useful for making the page look a specific way, and still follow the web standards.

A common example is making inline <li> elements for horizontal menus:

Example
li {
  display: inline;
}
Note: Setting the display property of an element only changes how the element is displayed, NOT what kind of element it is. So, an inline element with display: block; is not allowed to have other block elements inside it.

The following example displays <span> elements as block elements:

Example
span {
  display: block;
}
The following example displays <a> elements as block elements:

Example
a {
  display: block;
}
