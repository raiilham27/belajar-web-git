// JavaScript / ECMAScript
// JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

// It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

// After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. (Identical to ES5).

// Internet Explorer (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).
