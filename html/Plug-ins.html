The <object> Element
    The <object> element is supported by all browsers.

        The <object> element defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

            It was designed to embed plug-ins (like Java applets, PDF readers, and Flash Players) in web pages, but can
            also be used to include HTML in HTML:

            Example
            <object width="100%" height="500px" data="snippet.html"></object>
            Or images if you like:

            Example
            <object data="audi.jpeg"></object>

            The <embed> Element
            The <embed> element is supported in all major browsers.

            The <embed> element also defines an embedded object within an HTML document.

            Web browsers have supported the <embed> element for a long time. However, it has not been a part of the HTML
            specification before HTML5.

            Example
            <embed src="audi.jpeg">The <embed> element can also be used to include HTML in HTML:

            Example
            <embed width="100%" height="500px" src="snippet.html">
            Struggling with Video Formats?
            Converting videos to different formats can be difficult and time-consuming.

            An easier solution is to let YouTube play the videos in your web page.

            YouTube Video Id
            YouTube will display an id (like tgbNymZ7vqY), when you save (or play) a video.

            You can use this id, and refer to your video in the HTML code.

            Playing a YouTube Video in HTML
            To play your video on a web page, do the following:

            Upload the video to YouTube
            Take a note of the video id
            Define an <iframe> element in your web page
                Let the src attribute point to the video URL
                Use the width and height attributes to specify the dimension of the player
                Add any other parameters to the URL (see below)
                Example
                <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgbNymZ7vqY">
                </iframe>
