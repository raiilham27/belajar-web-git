What is Web API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is some kind of interface that includes a set of functions and
subroutines that allow programmers to access specific features or data of an application, operating system or other
services.

A Web API is an application programming interface for the Web.

HTML APIs
All browsers have a set of built-in Web APIs to support complex operations, and to help accessing data.

Here are some of the main HTML5 APIs:

1. Geolocation API - This API is used to access the current location of a user (with latitude and longitude).

2. Drag and Drop API - This API enables you to use drag-and-drop features in browsers.

3. Web Storage API - This API has mechanisms to let browsers store key/value pairs (in a more intuitive way than
cookies).

4. Web Workers API - This API allows a JavaScript to run in the background, without affecting the performance of the
page. Users can continue to do whatever they want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the
background.

5. Server-Sent Events API - This API allows a web page to automatically get updates from a server.

6. Canvas API - This API lets you draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

Notes on Using HTML APIs
When implementing an HTML API, you should always:

Check Browser Capability - Always check that the target browsers support the API. Always add script or message to be run
if a browser does not support it.

Add Robust Error Handling - Add robust error handling to take care of scenarios where an API may not function as
expected, to ensure a seamless user experience.

Request User Permission - When using an API that accesses sensitive data, like the Geolocation API (which will access
the user's geographical position), always prompt the user for consent before proceeding.

Third Party APIs
Third party APIs are not built into your browser.

To use these APIs, you will have to download the code from the Web.

Examples:

YouTube API - Allows you to display videos on a web site.
Twitter API - Allows you to display Tweets on a web site.
Facebook API - Allows you to display Facebook info on a web site.
