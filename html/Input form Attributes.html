The form Attribute
The input form attribute specifies the form the <input> element belongs to.

The value of this attribute must be equal to the id attribute of the <form> element it belongs to.

    Example
    An input field located outside of the HTML form (but still a part of the form):

    <form action="/action_page.php" id="form1">
        <label for="fname">First name:</label>
        <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>

    <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" form="form1">
    The formaction Attribute
    The input formaction attribute specifies the URL of the file that will process the input when the form is submitted.

    Note: This attribute overrides the action attribute of the <form> element.

        The formaction attribute works with the following input types: submit and image.

        Example
        An HTML form with two submit buttons, with different actions:

        <form action="/action_page.php">
            <label for="fname">First name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
            <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
            <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
            <input type="submit" formaction="/action_page2.php" value="Submit as Admin">
        </form>

        The formenctype Attribute
        The input formenctype attribute specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitted (only for forms
        with method="post").

        Note: This attribute overrides the enctype attribute of the <form> element.

            The formenctype attribute works with the following input types: submit and image.

            Example
            A form with two submit buttons. The first sends the form-data with default encoding, the second sends the
            form-data encoded as "multipart/form-data":

            <form action="/action_page_binary.asp" method="post">
                <label for="fname">First name:</label>
                <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
                <input type="submit" value="Submit">
                <input type="submit" formenctype="multipart/form-data" value="Submit as Multipart/form-data">
            </form>The formmethod Attribute
            The input formmethod attribute defines the HTTP method for sending form-data to the action URL.

            Note: This attribute overrides the method attribute of the <form> element.

                The formmethod attribute works with the following input types: submit and image.

                The form-data can be sent as URL variables (method="get") or as an HTTP post transaction
                (method="post").

                Notes on the "get" method:

                This method appends the form-data to the URL in name/value pairs
                This method is useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark the result
                There is a limit to how much data you can place in a URL (varies between browsers), therefore, you
                cannot be sure that all of the form-data will be correctly transferred
                Never use the "get" method to pass sensitive information! (password or other sensitive information will
                be visible in the browser's address bar)
                Notes on the "post" method:

                This method sends the form-data as an HTTP post transaction
                Form submissions with the "post" method cannot be bookmarked
                The "post" method is more robust and secure than "get", and "post" does not have size limitations
                Example
                A form with two submit buttons. The first sends the form-data with method="get". The second sends the
                form-data with method="post":

                <form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
                    <label for="fname">First name:</label>
                    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
                    <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
                    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
                    <input type="submit" value="Submit using GET">
                    <input type="submit" formmethod="post" value="Submit using POST">
                </form>
