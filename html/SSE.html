Server-Sent Events - One Way Messaging
A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets messages/updates from a server.

Normally, a web page has to request data from the server, but with server-sent events, the updates are pushed
automatically.

Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock market updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.

Receive Server-Sent Event Notifications
The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications:

Example
<script>
    const x = document.getElementById("result");
    // Check browser support for SSE
    if (typeof (EventSource) !== "undefined") {
        var source = new EventSource("demo_sse.php");
        source.onmessage = function (event) {
            x.innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
        };
    } else {
        x.innerHTML = "Sorry, no support for server-sent events.";
    }
</script>
