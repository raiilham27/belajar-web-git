Example
On submit, send form data to "action_page.php":

<form action="/action_page.php">
    <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
Tip: If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.

The Target Attribute
The target attribute specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

Example
Here, the submitted result will open in a new browser tab:

<form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank">

    The Method Attribute
    The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data.

    The form-data can be sent as URL variables (with method="get") or as HTTP post transaction (with method="post").

    The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET.

    Example
    This example uses the GET method when submitting the form data:

    <form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
        Example
        This example uses the POST method when submitting the form data:

        <form action="/action_page.php" method="post">
            Notes on GET:

            Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
            NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
            The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
            Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
            GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
            Notes on POST:

            Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
            POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
            Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
